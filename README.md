# Certible is an independent organisation based in the heart of Vienna, performing certification exams worldwide.

Our main field of activity is the international personnel certification in numerous branches of the IT sector. Thanks to our worldwide network of examiners we are able to respond very flexibly in time and location to any customer request.

We are proud to provide all aspects of the certification service ourselves. This includes the development of our proprietary examination software and directly employing our own team of invigilators.

Our service includes the complete examination process, from a quick and easy sign-up process, modern test management with secure data transfer, to fast test-evaluation and issuing of high quality of printed certificates. We offer multiple ways to get certified, whether in groups or individually:

## Remote exams

Take your examination whenever you want, from home or work, using your own computer. Certible offers group exams for companies or training providers as well as the option to choose an individual appointment. Please see our remote exams info page for further details.

## At locations provided by training-centres

Training centres offer the benefit of providing both in-house and remote exam locations, where we conduct certification exams afterwards.

## On-site at companies

Companies can conveniently book a package of on-site training followed by our independent certification process.

## Public exams

We offer public examination dates at our headquarters in Vienna as well as numerous other locations. This service is mainly intended for candidates who prefer to study on their own, or request follow-up exams.
